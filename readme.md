# Azure App Migration Workshop Home

This repository provides links out to elements used in the 2019 "Migrating Applications to the Cloud" Workshops run in Australia.

Our primary application codebases for the Tailwind Traders demo company can be found in the following Repositories:

- Inventory Service (ASP.Net Core): https://github.com/sjwaight/AzureMigrationDotNet
- Product Service (NodeJS): https://github.com/sjwaight/AzureAppMigrationNode
- Frontend SPA (React): https://github.com/sjwaight/AzureAppMigrationReact
- Reports Functions (NodeJS): https://github.com/sjwaight/AzureAppMigrationServerless

We are mainly using Azure DevOps to deploy these codebases to Azure, though for the Inventory Service we are using [Oryx](https://github.com/Microsoft/Oryx), which is built into Azure App Service's [Deployment Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-continuous-deployment).
